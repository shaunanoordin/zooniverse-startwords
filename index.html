    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome! This website contains supplementary content for the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/" target="_blank">Zooniverse</a>
      article published on <a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Startwords</a>
      in 2021/2022. Contains HTML + JavaScript examples for the multi-language
      transcription keyboard built for the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza" target="_blank">Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</a>
      website.

    <p>
      The following sections describe <b>how to build your own basic
      multi-language transcription keyboard</b> from scratch, and is designed
      for <i>researchers and programmers with some understanding of HTML and
      JavaScript.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're a more experienced web developer who's very familiar with React,
      you may want to jump straight into the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza" target="_blank">Scribes of the Cairo Geniza repo</a>,
      possibly starting with the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/blob/master/src/components/AnnotationKeyboard.jsx" target="_blank">AnnotationKeyboard</a>
      component.

    <h2>The Basics: A Form With Some Text Input</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by setting up a very basic web form. It has one text input
      field, one submit button, and one output panel.
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-01.html" width="640" height="240"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-01.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p>
      This example breaks down the idea of a "text transcription website" to its
      simplest form. The text input field is what the user types into, and the
      output panel is (let's pretend) the server they're submitting their
      transcriptions to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything we build from this point onwards is meant to solve one very
      simple problem: <b>how do we allow users to type, into that text input
      field, in a language that's not native to theirs?</b> e.g. how do we help
      a user type in the text "ごはんを食べる" when they only have a
      US-International QWERTY keyboard, and we don't want to ask them to futz
      about in their computer settings to install a Japanese language pack?
    </p>

    <h2>A Simple Keyboard</h2>
    <p>
      A straightforward solution is to create an on-screen keyboard for the
      user. In this example, we create an a Japanese keyboard with 5 characters.
      Clicking on each button/"keyboard key" adds the corresponding character
      to the end of the text input box.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      (Note: we're using the Japanese hiragana characters あいうえお here because
      they map easily to the English characters AIUEO, and are written
      left-to-right. We'll build up to more complex alphabets, such as Hebrew
      and its right-to-left layout, in later sections.)
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-02.html" width="640" height="240"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-02.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p>
      The code here is simple, but we already come across a problem: what if a
      user wants to add a Japanese character in the middle (instead of at the
      end) of the text box? This is, after all, a very basic function for a
      normal text box - you can place the text cursor/caret at any part of
      the existing text and then start typing.
