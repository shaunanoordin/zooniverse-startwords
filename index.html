    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      Welcome! This website contains supplementary content for the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/" target="_blank">Zooniverse</a>
      article published on <a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Startwords</a>
      in 2021/2022. Contains HTML + JavaScript examples for the multi-language
      transcription keyboard built for the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza" target="_blank">Scribes of the Cairo Geniza</a>
      website.
    </p>
    <p>
      The following sections describe <b>how to build your own basic
      multi-language transcription keyboard</b> from scratch, and is designed
      for <i>researchers and programmers with some understanding of HTML and
      JavaScript.</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you're a more experienced web developer who's very familiar with React,
      you may want to jump straight into the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza" target="_blank">Scribes of the Cairo Geniza repo</a>,
      possibly starting with the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/blob/master/src/components/AnnotationKeyboard.jsx" target="_blank">AnnotationKeyboard</a>
      component.

    <h2>The Basics: A Form With Some Text Input</h2>
    <p>
      Let's start by setting up a very basic web form. It has one text input
      field, one submit button, and one output panel.
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-01.html" width="640" height="240"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-01.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p>
      This example breaks down the idea of a "text transcription website" to its
      simplest form. The text input field is what the user types into, and the
      output panel is (let's pretend) the server they're submitting their
      transcriptions to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything we build from this point onwards is meant to solve one very
      simple problem: <b>how do we allow users to type, into that text input
      field, in a language that's not native to theirs?</b> e.g. how do we help
      a user type in the text "ごはんを食べる" when they only have a
      US-International QWERTY keyboard, and we don't want to ask them to futz
      about in their computer settings to install a Japanese language pack?
