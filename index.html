      Welcome! This website contains supplementary content for the <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/" target="_blank">Zooniverse</a>
      article published on <a href="https://startwords.cdh.princeton.edu/" target="_blank">Startwords</a>

      The following sections describe <b>how to build your own basic on-screen
      multi-language transcription keyboard</b> from scratch, and is designed
      for <i>researchers and programmers with some understanding of HTML and
      JavaScript.</i>

      If you're a more experienced web developer who's very familiar with React,
      you may want to jump straight into the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza" target="_blank">Scribes of the Cairo Geniza repo</a>,
      possibly starting with the <a href="https://github.com/zooniverse/scribes-of-the-cairo-geniza/blob/master/src/components/AnnotationKeyboard.jsx" target="_blank">AnnotationKeyboard</a>
      component.

  <h2>A HTML Form</h2>
  <section>
    <a name="section-01"></a>
    <h3>01. The Basics: A Form With Some Text Input</h3>
    <p>
      Let's start by setting up a very basic web form. It has one text input
      field, one submit button, and one output panel.
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-01.html" width="640" height="240"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-01.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p>
      This example breaks down the idea of a "text transcription website" to its
      simplest form. The text input field is what the user types into, and the
      output panel is (let's pretend) the server they're submitting their
      transcriptions to.
    </p>
    <p>
      Everything we build from this point onwards is meant to solve one very
      simple problem: <b>how do we allow users to type, into that text input
      field, in a language that's not native to theirs?</b> e.g. how do we help
      a user type in the text "ごはんを食べる" when they only have a
      US-International QWERTY keyboard, and we don't want to ask them to futz
      about in their computer settings to install a Japanese language pack?
    </p>

    <h3>02. A Simple On-screen Keyboard</h3>
    <p>
      A straightforward solution is to create an on-screen keyboard for the
      user. In this example, we create an a Japanese keyboard with 5 characters.
      Clicking on each button/"keyboard key" adds the corresponding character
      to the end of the text input field.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: we're using the Japanese hiragana characters あいうえお here because
      they map easily to the English characters AIUEO, and are written
      left-to-right. We'll build up to more complex alphabets, such as Hebrew
      and its right-to-left layout, in later sections.
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-02.html" width="640" height="320"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-02.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p>
      The code here is simple, but we already come across a problem: what if the
      user wants to add a Japanese character in the middle (instead of at the
      end) of the text box? This is, after all, a very basic function for a
      normal text box - you can place the text cursor/caret at any part of
      the existing text and then start typing.
    </p>
  </section>
  <section>
    <a name="section-03"></a>
    <h3>03. Text Selection</h3>
    <p>
      This is actually a solved problem: we use the standard <code>HTMLInputElement</code>'s
      <code>selectionStart</code>, <code>selectionEnd</code>, and <code>setSelectionRange</code>
      to interact with the "text cursor" on the text input field.
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-03.html" width="640" height="320"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-03.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p>
      In the example above, we've done two things in the code: 1. we ensure the
      Japanese characters are inserted at the position of the text cursor/caret,
      and 2. we ensure the text input maintains focus after the insertion. These
      may seem like minor coding considerations, but they're important to
      <b>ensure a consistent UX (User Experience), since users often have
      pre-set expectations on how UI (User Interface) elements should
      behave</b>.

    <h3>04. Physical Keyboard Key Capture</h3>
    <p>
      Alright, so we now have an on-screen keyboard. But what about the user's
      physical keyboard? A user might find it easier to use their physical
      keyboard to do text transcription, compared to clicking each on-screen
      keyboard button individually. With that in mind, let's try to translate
      those physical key presses into our custom character input.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, when the user presses the 'A' key on their keyboard,
      the Japanese character あ is inserted into the text field instead. Same
      for the other characters: A -> あ , I -> い, U -> う, E -> え, O -> お
    </p>
    <iframe src="./section-04.html" width="640" height="320"></iframe>
    <a class="link-to-code" href="https://github.com/shaunanoordin/zooniverse-startwords/blob/master/section-04.html" target="_blank">(view source code)</a>
    <p class="note">
      If you have an on-screen keyboard AND you're capturing physical key input,
      it's a good idea to label those on-screen keyboard buttons with the
      corresponding physical keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the biggest considerations here is <b>what kind of physical
      keyboard does your user have?</b> In our examples, we're making a very
      hard assumption that all our users have US-International QWERTY keyboards,
      and we choose to map <i>physical keyboard keys</i> to their replacement
      characters.
    </p>
    <p class="note">
      Note: there are different ways to get what the user typed into a text
      field. <code>keyboardEvent.code</code> corresponds to the PHYSICAL key on
      the keyboard. <code>keyboardEvent.key</code> corresponds to the TEXT VALUE
      of the key. If a user presses the 'A' key on a US-International QWERTY
      keyboard, we get <code>code='KeyA'</code>, and <code>key='a'</code> (if
      shift/capslock is off) or <code>key='A'</code> (if shift/capslock is on).
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>WARNING:</b> now that we know <i>how</i> to capture and replace
      keyboard input, we also need to learn <i>when not to do so.</i> Sometimes,
      when a user presses the 'A' key, they just want to type in the character
      'A', not 'あ'! <b>Always allow your users the option to disable your
      on-screen keyboard.</b> The example above has no such option, but we'll
      explore how we can do this once we jump into the "multi-language"
      functionality of our onscreen keyboard.

    <h3>05. Code Cleanup</h3>
    <p>
      Before we proceed with the advanced considerations of creating an
      on-screen keyboard with multiple languages, let's clean up our code.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the example below, you won't see many changes in terms of UI
      functionality, but a lot of the source code was altered. Notably:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        The Japanese characters have now been compiled into a "Japanese
        keyboard" data object, setting the stage for <b>dynamically-generated
        keyboards</b> for different languages.
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly, we now have "English keyboard" and "QWERTY layout" data
        objects that help ensure <b>the visual layout of the on-screen keyboard
        matches the user's physical keyboard.</b>
      </li>
    </ul>
